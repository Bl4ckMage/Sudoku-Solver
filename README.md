# Sudoku Solver
 a little program that just me taking my first steps into coding. 
Using Recusion for the first time was hard, I don't think the implementation is amazing, but it's a start
first time using vectors as well. really its the first time for everything.

(given its not really optimal, buteforcing an expert level will take a longtime to go though all the combinations!
